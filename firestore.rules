/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for cyclist data and an admin-based model for homepage content.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores cyclist profiles, with 'userId' matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/bikes/{bikeId}: Stores bikes owned by the cyclist, with a denormalized 'ownerId' field.
 * - /users/{userId}/bikes/{bikeId}/theftReports/{theftReportId}: Stores theft reports for a specific bike.
 * - /bike_shops/{bikeShopId}: Stores bike shop profiles (currently open reads, restricted writes).
 * - /home_page_sections/{homePageSectionId}: Stores editable homepage sections, accessible only by admins.
 * - /roles_admin/{uid}: Used to grant admin privileges; presence of a document with the user's UID grants admin access.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly owned and controlled by the authenticated user (CRUD operations).
 * - Bikes and TheftReports inherit ownership from their parent cyclist.
 * - Listing users is not permitted.
 * - HomePageSections are only accessible by admins, determined by membership in the /roles_admin collection.
 * - BikeShops are readable by everyone, but write operations should be restricted to admins or the bike shop itself (TODO).
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'ownerId' field is denormalized in the Bike document to avoid costly `get()` calls and enable simpler, more performant security rules.
